    "### The Explanation\n",
    "Why is this the case? The best way to explain this is by referencing a similar problem within our own base-10 number system that we use in everyday life. The concept of a third is something that obviously exists, but is impossible to fully write out in its decimal form. We use shortcuts such as `1/3` or `0.333...` but the true value is a decimal point followed by an infinite amount of threes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar situation happens with computers, but rather than operating in a base-10 number system, computers use binary (1s and 0s) instead. Certain math operations can cause the same exact issue for computers where the true value is a number infinitely repeating. In binary, this may look something like a pattern of 1s and 0s repeating forever (e.g., `100100100100...`). Like us, computers can't count to infinity so they also take a shortcut! After a certain amount of repetition, the computer rounds the last digit and calls it a day."

    "### The Solution\n",
    "There are a number of different ways to handle this issue, some of which can be fairly complicated depending on the operations being performed. For this simple example, here are some basic solutions:\n",
    "- Convert each variable to an `int` by multiplying by a factor of 10, perform the operation, and then divide by a factor of 10\n",
    "- Use the `decimal` library which comes preinstalled as part of the standard libraries of Python ([more info](https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html))\n",
